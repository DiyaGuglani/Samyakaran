## Key Features

1. **Ethereum Wallet Tracking**:
   - Track Ethereum wallet addresses and visualize transaction flows.
   - Display transaction history in a tabular format for easy review.

2. **Blacklist Checker**:
   - Integrated with the ChainAbuse API to check if an Ethereum wallet address is flagged as suspicious.

3. **Interactive Transaction Graph**:
   - Uses D3.js for dynamic visualization of transaction networks, with node and edge interactions, showing transaction amounts and connections.

4. **Transaction Filtering**:
   - Filters transactions based on criteria like amount, date range, etc.
   - Provides alerts for large transactions and supports real-time text-to-speech notifications.

5. **Graph Exporting**:
   - Allows users to export the transaction graph as a PDF for offline analysis.

## User Guide

1. **Track Wallet Balance**:
   - Enter an Ethereum wallet address to check its ba
   - lance and transaction history.

2. **Visualize Transactions**:
   - Input a wallet address to see a dynamic graph of its transactions, including transaction size and connections.

3. **Filter Transactions**:
   - Apply filters (date range, amount) to focus on specific transactions and visualize them accordingly.

4. **Check Blacklisted Addresses**:
   - Enter a wallet address to verify if itâ€™s flagged as suspicious using the ChainAbuse API.

5. **Export Transaction Graph**:
   - Users can export the visualized transaction graph as a PDF for reporting or offline analysis.
